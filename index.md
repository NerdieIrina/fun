# Irina Petrova

After seven years in industry and becoming a Senior Front-end developer, I still find joy in learning and building products.

Collaborating with different teams, putting ideas to paper and forming and providing honest feedback is where I thrive.

I have a strong understanding of UI/UX, experience of developing scalable applications in React and Typescript, and delivering features in a timely manner.
